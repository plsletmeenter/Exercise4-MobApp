Word analyzer determines the number of vowels and consonants that the user inputs.
when the word analyzer detects the word, it will count the vowels and consonants here is how:
first we intialize the vowels, consonants and the character to 0
the user will input the word
the word analyzer will start to calculate the length of the word 
and store it in an array and will go through the analyze function by also using the split
If i < character, which will match the character that is listed in the Square bracket 
then it will count each time it detects a vowel 
else a consanants
and then finally displays the results.
